        My baking collection has been gathered throughout my many
        years of baking. With my <b><i>college graduation</i></b> coming up, I have been

        to my career and family.

    <p>
        Some items in this collection will be <i>edible</i>,
        but this also means that they are <i><b>perishable</b></i>,
        so that must be kept in mind while purchasing. If an item expires 
        before they are purchased, I will <b>notify</b> those with inqueries
        and remove that item from the listing.
